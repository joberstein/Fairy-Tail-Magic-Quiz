Instructions and Features

Run the program in Processing and then click the on-screen start button. Read the prompt and answer it by clicking on one of the choices. The home button may be clicked at any time, allowing the user to return to the home screen. The back button will only appear after the first prompt has been answered, and can be used to move back a prompt in case the user has answered it mistakenly or wants to explore other options.

Once enough choices have been made, the user will reach an ending!  An ending contains text that is specific to the sequence of options selected, as well as an image pertaining to the user's choices as well.

This quiz was created with information extracted from an XML document, and focuses on the concept of dynamic navigation.
